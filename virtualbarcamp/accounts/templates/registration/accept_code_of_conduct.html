                        <p><strong>We take our code of conduct very seriously &amp; you should too</strong></p>

                        <p>BarCamp Manchester is dedicated to providing a harassment-free unconference
                            experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
                            sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age
                            or religion.</p>

                        <p>We do not tolerate harassment of unconference participants in any form.
                            Unconference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
                            from the unconference at the discretion of the BarCamp Manchester volunteers.</p>

                        <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
                                gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
                                physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
                            </li>
                            <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.</li>
                            <li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
                            <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
                            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
                            <li>Persistent uninvited criticism of a talk or a BarCamp volunteer.</li>
                            <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Enforcement</h3>

                        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                            immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>

                        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the
                            right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all
                            participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
                            unconference.</p>

                        <p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the
                            clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for
                            any participants.</p>

                        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
                            event-related social activities.</p>

                        <h3>Reporting</h3>

                        <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
                            as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce
                            the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event.
                            People like you make our event a better place.</p>

                        <p>You can make a report by sending a direct message to one of the volunteer organisers.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Chris Northwood @laser</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>When taking a report, our volunteers will ensure complete privacy. They may
                            involve other volunteers to ensure your report is managed properly. When you
                            message us we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be
                            upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible. You won’t be
                            asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.</p>

                        <p>Our volunteers will be happy to assist you to feel safe for the duration of
                            the event. We value your attendance.</p>

                        <p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek
                            Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>

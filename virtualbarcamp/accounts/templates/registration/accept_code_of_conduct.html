                        <p>BarCamp Manchester is dedicated to providing a harassment-free unconference
                            experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
                            expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                            race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of unconference
                            participants in any form. Unconference participants violating these rules
                            may be sanctioned or expelled from the unconference at the discretion of
                            the BarCamp Manchester volunteers.</p>

                                gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
                                physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.</li>

                            <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>

                        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                            immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>

                        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the
                            right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all
                            participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
                            unconference.</p>

                        <p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the
                            clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for
                            any participants.</p>

                        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
                            event-related social activities.</p>

                        <h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

                        <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
                            as soon as possible. BarCamp volunteers can be identified by the colour of their
                            name in the Discord chats, and are highlighted in the plenaries.</p>

                        <p>Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event
                            for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our
                            event a better place.</p>

                        <p>You can make a report by:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In the first instance, contacting Chris Northwood via Discord, e-mailing
                                <a href="mailto:chris@barcampmanchester.co.uk">chris@barcampmanchester.co.uk</a>, or by
                                calling or messaging 07880862720.</li>
                            <li>In the event that it is not appropriate to report this to Chris, please
                                contact another volunteer in the Discord.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 id="contacting-a-volunteer-in-person-at-the-event">What happens when a report is made</h4>

                        <p>When taking a report, our volunteers will communicate with you via direct message.
                            They may involve other volunteers to ensure your report is managed
                            properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be
                            upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring
                            someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t
                            tell anyone who you are.</p>

                        <p>Our volunteers will be happy to help you contact security, police, local
                            support services, or otherwise assist you to feel
                            safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

                        <p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek
                            Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>
